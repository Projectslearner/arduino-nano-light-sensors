# Light Sensors

#### Project Overview

The Light Sensors project demonstrates how to interface light sensors with an Arduino Nano to measure ambient light levels. Light sensors are widely used in various applications such as automatic lighting systems, security systems, and environmental monitoring. This project provides a basic setup for reading analog values from a light sensor and displaying them on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Light Sensor (e.g., LDR or Phototransistor)**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Light Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the output pin of the light sensor to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure proper voltage levels and grounding for stable operation of the light sensor.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the light sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the Serial Monitor.
   - Observe the Serial Monitor to view the light sensor values displayed in real-time.
   - Cover or expose the light sensor to different light conditions to observe changes in sensor readings.

#### Applications

- **Automatic Lighting Systems:** Use light sensors to control the brightness of lights based on ambient light levels.
- **Security Systems:** Incorporate light sensors into security systems to detect unauthorized entry by changes in light levels.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Measure light levels in indoor or outdoor environments for environmental monitoring purposes.

#### Notes

- Experiment with different types of light sensors (e.g., LDRs, phototransistors) to observe variations in sensitivity and response to light.
- Calibrate the sensor readings if necessary to adapt to specific lighting conditions.
- Ensure proper placement of the light sensor to accurately measure ambient light levels.
